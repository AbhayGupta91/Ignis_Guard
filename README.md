#Ignis Guard ‚Äì Smart Fire Detection and Alert System

Ignis Guard is a smart fire detection project built using Arduino Uno and SIM900 GSM Module. It detects fire using a flame sensor and immediately sends **SMS alerts** and **makes calls** to pre-saved mobile numbers. The system also activates an LED and buzzer alarm for immediate surroundings.
